***How it works:***

Let's say you are learning Spanish:

- Open a Spanish movie, with Spanish subtitles, and optionally 2nd subtitles in your language.
- Hover over any word to see translations to your language, click on it to save it to dictionary.
- You can mark words with 4 levels of familiarity (New - red, Recognized - orange, Familiar - yellow and Known - green)
- You can look up list of saved words any time and read subtitles in subtitle listing mode.
